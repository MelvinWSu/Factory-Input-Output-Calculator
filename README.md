# Factory-Input-Output-Calculator

## Background

Factorio and Satisfactory are factory-building games. The flow of the game is to manually mine early-game resources, manually craft tools and process materials, change to automatic mining, and ultimately end up managing a large variety of resources and crafting recipes. 

## Goal

•	Allows the user to type into fields the input item(s), the rate of arrival, the number needed to craft the output, and the time it takes to craft the output. The app will generate a chart with all the input/output info along with any bottlenecks.
•	Build a website you can log in to save and load previous calculations

## Platform

•	Web application

## Tools

•	React Bootstrap

•	Sass

•	Firebase

•	Some kind of flowchart API

•	Google Login API

## Development Steps

1.	Two inputs, output bottleneck result
2.	Multiple inputs, output crafting time
3.	Graph generation
4.	Login Creation/Support
5.	Multiple output support
6.	Multi-stage crafting
7.	Save to profile
