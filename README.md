# Factory-Input-Output-Calculator

## Background

Factorio and Satisfactory are factory-building games. The flow of the game is to manually mine early-game resources, manually craft tools and process materials, change to automatic mining, and ultimately end up managing a large variety of resources and crafting recipes. 

## Goal

•	Allows the user to type into fields the input item(s), the rate of arrival, the number needed to craft the output, and the time it takes to craft the output. The app will generate a chart with all the input/output info along with any bottlenecks.

•	Build a website you can log in to save and load previous calculations

## Platform

•	Web application

## Tools

•	React Bootstrap (Front-end framework)

• Javascript/JSX (Back-end framework)
 
• React Hooks (dynamic forms)

•	Sass

•	Firebase (Realtime Database, FirebaseUI)

•	Some kind of flowchart API (Output results in an easy to interpet format)

## Development Steps

1.	Two inputs, output bottleneck result
2.	Multiple inputs
3.	Multiple output support
4.	Login Creation/Support
5.	Save to profile/ Load
7.	Graph generation
9.	Multi-stage crafting

## Future Plans
 
1. Implement search for pre-requisite recipies needed
2. Make online database, change input/output names to items
